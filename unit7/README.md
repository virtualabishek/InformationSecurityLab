# Comprehensive Notes for Unit 7

## 7.1 IT Security Management

**Definition and Objectives**:
IT Security Management involves overseeing and protecting an organization’s information assets by implementing policies, procedures, and technologies to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad). It aims to:

- Protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats.
- Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
- Minimize downtime and maintain business continuity.
- Justify security investments, with cyber attacks occurring every 40 seconds and ransomware attacks up 400% year over year ([Hyperproof](https://hyperproof.io/resource/it-risk-assessment/)).

**Core Components**:

- **Policies and Procedures**: Define acceptable use, access control, and incident response.
- **Security Awareness Training**: Educate employees on phishing, password hygiene, and social engineering.
- **Technology Implementation**: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), encryption, and antivirus software.
- **Monitoring and Review**: Continuous monitoring and periodic assessments.
- **Sub-disciplines**: Operational risk management (ORM) and supply chain risk management (SCRM).

**Frameworks**:

- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Guides identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery ([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

**Steps**:

1. Identify assets (hardware, software, data).
2. Assess risks and vulnerabilities.
3. Implement controls (technical, administrative, physical).
4. Monitor and review effectiveness.
5. Update policies based on emerging threats.

**Best Practices**:

- Integrate security by design into business processes.

2. **Threat Identification**: Identify threats (e.g., malware, insider threats).
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify weaknesses (e.g., unpatched software).
4. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluate likelihood and impact.
5. **Risk Prioritization**: Rank risks (high, medium, low).
6. **Mitigation Planning**: Recommend controls.

**Tools and Frameworks**:

- Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS).
- Penetration testing.
- Frameworks: NIST SP 800-30, OCTAVE, FAIR Model ([FAIR Institute](https://www.fairinstitute.org/)).

**Outputs**:

- Risk register: Lists risks, severity, and mitigation plans.
- Control recommendations.

**Best Practices**:

- Conduct annually or after major changes (e.g., remote work shifts).
- Use frameworks for structure.
- Address new risks like phishing from remote work trends.

## 7.4 Security Risk Analysis

**Definition**:
Security Risk Analysis evaluates risks to determine their potential impact and likelihood, enabling informed decisions.

**Types**:

- **Qualitative**: Uses descriptive scales (high, medium, low) for quick assessments.
- **Quantitative**: Uses numerical data (e.g., Annual Loss Expectancy) with historical data.

**Key Metrics**:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- **Impact**: Potential damage (financial, reputational, operational).
- **Risk Level**: Likelihood × Impact.

**Steps**:

1. Collect data on threats, vulnerabilities, and assets.
2. Assign likelihood and impact scores.
3. Calculate risk levels.
4. Document findings.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Avoid**: Eliminate risk (e.g., remove outdated systems).
- **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood/impact (e.g., patches, backups).
- **Transfer**: Shift risk (e.g., cyber insurance).
- **Accept**: Monitor low-priority risks.

## 7.5 Security Auditing Architecture

  - Penetration tests: Simulate attacks.
  - Compliance audits: Verify standards.
  - Risk assessments.

**Process**:

1. Plan audit (scope, objectives, criteria).
2. Collect evidence (logs, configurations).
3. Analyze findings.
4. Report results and recommendations.
5. Follow up on remediation.

**Frequency**:

- Twice yearly for sensitive data handlers; 4-5 days for testing, 2-3 for rescan ([GetAstra](https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/it-security-audit/)).

## 7.6 Security Audit Trails

**Definition and Purpose**:
Security Audit Trails are records of system activities for accountability and investigation. They aim to:

- **Timestamps**: When events occurred.
- **User IDs**: Who performed actions.
- **Event Details**: Action descriptions.

**Activity Tracked**:

- Administrative (e.g., user account changes).
- Data access/modification (e.g., file downloads).
- User denials/login failures.
- System-wide changes (e.g., VM instance changes).

**Best Practices**:

- Enable logging on critical systems.
- Protect logs from tampering (encryption, offsite storage).
- Retain logs per regulations (e.g., 7 years for Sarbanes-Oxley).
- Review logs regularly ([Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/audit-trails-and-logs)).

**Differences**:

- Audit logs: Immutable, for compliance.
- Regular logs: For troubleshooting.

## 7.7 Implementing Logging Function

**Definition**:
Configuring systems to capture, store, and manage audit trails effectively.

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Requirements**: Systems/events to log (e.g., authentication).
2. **Configure Mechanisms**: Enable logging in OS, apps, devices.
3. **Centralize Storage**: Use SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk).
4. **Secure Logs**: Encrypt, restrict access.
5. **Test Functionality**: Verify event capture.

**Tools**:
