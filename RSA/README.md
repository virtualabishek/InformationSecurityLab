#RSA

RSA is one of the most well-known and widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.

it uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

and symentric uses the same key

The security of RSA relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
